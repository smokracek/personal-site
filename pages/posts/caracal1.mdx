# Caracal - Building a library to enable social networking over BitTorrent
#### 2 March 2023

Starting this January I began work on creating a library I'm calling [Caracal](https://github.com/smokracek/caracal). 
My hope is to provide facilities for implementing clients that can participate in a social network that works over the 
peer-to-peer file sharing protocol BitTorrent. At the moment, my key goals are:

    * Provide primitives for torrenting and seeding with magnet links.
    * Provide tools for generating magnet links and torrent files for any file or bundle of files.
    * Provide tools for communicating with and polling a repository that stores magnet links pointing to net
    posts on the network.
    * Provide tools for encrypting posts using public key encryption. Even though all files are available
    to everyone when using BitTorrent, only friends/followers will be able to actually decrypt a post.
    * Expose it all via a C interface that uses plain data objects, which will enable interoptibility and 
    easy binding with other languages.

The goal isn't to create a flashy client app (although I will make one), but rather provide all the facilities needed to create
a client app in many different contexts.

## Design Choices
### LibTorrent
I decided it wasn't a good idea to attempt to implement modern BitTorrent functionality myself, so I opted
to use [LibTorrent](https://libtorrent.org/index.html). As a result, many of my Caracal functions are really
light wrappers around LibTorrent functions that convert LibTorrent's C++ types to C types and structs. 

### Opaque Types
I also made the decision to use opaque C types. Opaque types allow me to take full control of how the client uses
the types that Caracal works in, and also implements some pseudo-OOP functionality in C. The following is an example
of how this is done for my `post_bundle_t` type. However, as I get deeper into this project a lot of the social 
networking-specific functionality will need to be implemented myself.

This is the public header file `include/post_bundle.h` that the client has access to:
```c filename="post_bundle.h"
#ifndef CARACAL_POST_BUNDLE_H
#define CARACAL_POST_BUNDLE_H

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif

    /**
     * Holds info about a post.
     */
    typedef struct _post_bundle_instance_t *post_bundle_t;

    /**
     * Gets the title of the post. Derived from original post file name.
     * @param instance A post bundle.
     * @return The current title of the post.
     */
    const char *get_post_title(post_bundle_t instance);

    /**
     * Gets the magnet link for the post.
     * @param instance A post bundle.
     * @return The generated magnet link for the post.
     */
    const char *get_post_magnet(post_bundle_t instance);

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif

#endif
```
Now, jumping to the implementations in `src/post_bundle.h` and `src/post_bundle.cpp`, we see that we can hide any
and all implementation details from the client:
```c++ filename="post_bundle.h"
#include "../include/post_bundle.h"

typedef struct _post_bundle_instance_t
{
    char title[256];
    char magnet[1024];
} *post_bundle_t;
```
```cpp filename="post_bundle.cpp"
#include "post_bundle.h"

const char *get_post_title(post_bundle_t instance)
{
    return instance->title;
}

const char *get_post_magnet(post_bundle_t instance)
{
    return instance->magnet;
}
```
In short, the client only gets access to operations on the type we want them to, and they also don't need to mess
with pointers or anything else besides simple methods that act on instances.

### Singleton Sessions
I'm wrapping the LibTorrent `lt::session` object in a singleton class so to keep things simple. With this method, the user
can opaquely add magnets to torrent or seed, query the session for alerts, set storage directories, etc. The goal is to eventually
figure out how to background this into its own thread so downloading and seeding posts are non-blocking operations.

## Reflections so far
This project has been a ton of fun, especially since I'm typically used to programming that revolves around web sites or services.
While this isn't really systems programming, it feels much closer since I get to work in compiled languages like C and C++, and 
I'm not just implementing another REST API. I'll be working on this for at least the remainder of my semester, so check back in for
updates and keep an eye on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/smokracek/caracal).
